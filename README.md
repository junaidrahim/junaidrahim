# Hi, I am Junaid 👋

As of now, I am a CSE sophmore at KIIT University.


### What I am up to right now 👨‍💻 

* I am writing and recording some fun youtube tutorials on the C programming language [@DSCKIIT](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT). You can find them [here](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT/C-tutorials)

* I am working as a web developer for [Desire Foundation](https://github.com/desirefoundation) currently working on their blog infrastructure. It's mostly TypeScript, GatsbyJS, Express and SQL.


### I am currently learning 😁

I am trying to get better at the whole domain of deep learning. Math and computers have always fascinated my, I have some experience with ML and I am just trying to learn more. 
Currently doing the [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course by Andrew Ng and alongside that I am reading [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow.

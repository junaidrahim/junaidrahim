# Hi, I am Junaid 👋

I am a CSE junior at [KIIT University](https://kiit.ac.in/) and working in the Platform Team at [Atlan](https://atlan.com)

I'm a full stack engineer but lately I've been working mostly in backend and systems development. Currently working a lot with Argo Workflows, Kubernetes and Graph Databases.


### What I am up to right now 👨‍💻 

My day job at Atlan involves working a lot with argo workflows, containers, python, js and golang tooling and services. I'm also building a [graph database from scratch](https://github.com/FornaxDB) for my minor project in college.

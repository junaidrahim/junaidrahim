# Hi, I am Junaid 👋

I am a CSE sophomore at [KIIT University](https://kiit.ac.in/)

I started programming in high school, now I am trying to make a career out of my hobby. I love the world of backend and systems development. I know my fair share of languages, JS and Python are the one's I use the most, trying to do more of C++. Big time Linux fanboy 😅.

### What I am up to right now 👨‍💻 

* I am currently working on [Project Halide](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT/project-halide), it is an experimental operating system written from scratch. Loads of C++ and x86 assembly

### What I am currently learning 😁

I am trying to get better at the whole domain of deep learning. Math and computers have always fascinated me, I have some experience with ML and I am just trying to learn more. 
Currently doing the [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course by Andrew Ng and alongside that I am reading [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow. I am also trying to get better at Vim, because why not.
